## 📋 About
This repository contains the complete implementation of sentiment analysis for iPhone release tweets using Support Vector Machines (SVM), as presented in my research paper **"Sentiment Analysis Approach for Analyzing iPhone Release using Support Vector Machine"**.

## 🚀 Quick Start
Click the **"Open in Colab"** button above to run the code immediately in Google Colab without any installation.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming
2. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF with n-grams
3. **Classification**: SVM with linear kernel
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC analysis

## 📈 Results
The model demonstrates effective sentiment classification with comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations.
